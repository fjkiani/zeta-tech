# OPERATION: MAVERICK (Aviation High School) ✈️

**Mission**: Build the "A&P Copilot" to crush FAA Exams (General, Airframe, Powerplant).
**The Challenge**: You have to pass the 85% Qualifier and the 70% FAA Written. You need to remember stuff from 9th grade. You need to track your job sheets.
**The Solution**: We build an AI system that knows your specific engine, tracks your specific repairs, and drills you on your specific weak spots.
**The Context**: This is for the 16-week Saturday program (09:00 - 13:00).

## 📜 THE CLASSROOM O.S. (Rules of Engagement)
*Violating these rules causes engine failure. Do not ignore.*

1.  **No Blind Flying**: Never copy/paste AI output directly into graded work/logs.
2.  **Verify Instruments**: Anything numerical (torque specs, tolerances) or regulatory (FARs) **MUST** have a citation.
3.  **Stress Test**: Always ask the AI for a *counterexample* ("When would this rule NOT apply?").
4.  **Inspection Pass**: Always compare AI output to the Shop Manual *before* you touch the aircraft.
5.  **Log Your Flights**: Save your Prompts like code. They are your toolset for your 5th Year and beyond.

## 🛠️ THE 4 CAPABILITIES (Class Projects)

### 1. GENERAL KNOWLEDGE COPILOT (The Memory Bank)
**Target**: Revive 9th/10th Grade concepts for the 11th/12th Grade Exams.
**The Build**:
- **"Explain This" Engine**: Simplifies dense General topics (Electricity, Materials, Regs) into plain English + "Exam Language".
- **"Drill Sergeant"**: Generates MCQs based on specific ACS codes. Tracks what you miss.
- **Tools**: NotebookLM (fed with FAA-H-8083 textbooks), Perplexity.

### 2. PROCEDURE EXPLAINER (The Virtual Instructor)
**Target**: Master complex systems (Combustion Sections, Compression Checks, Heat Transfer).
**The Build**:
- **Procedure Generator**: Input "Lycoming O-320 Compression Test" -> Output: Step-by-Step Guide + Tool List + Common Mistakes.
- **Simulator Mode**: "Roleplay the engine. Give me symptoms (low pressure). Let me diagnose."
- **Tools**: ChatGPT/Claude (Scenario Logic), Verified against Manufacturer Manuals.

### 3. JOB SHEET TRACKER (The Digital Logbook)
**Target**: Log hands-on tasks for Oral/Practical exams.
**The Build**:
- **Input**: "I replaced the gasket on Cylinder 3 today. It was tricky aligning the studs."
- **AI Action**: Summarizes steps, tags it with ACS Code (e.g., *Powerplant: Reciprocating Engines*), generates 3 Flashcards for later study.
- **Result**: A personalized knowledge base built from your own work.
- **Tools**: Replit/Lovable (Simple App), Whisper (Voice Notes).

### 4. QUALIFIER COACH (The Strategist)
**Target**: The 85% Internal Qualifier & 70% FAA Written.
**The Build**:
- **Study Planner**: "I have 5 weeks. I am weak on Hydraulics. Build me a schedule."
- **Weekly Inspection**: "Quiz me only on what I missed last week."
- **Tools**: Gemini/GPT (Planning logic).

## 📅 THE 16-WEEK FLIGHT PLAN (Saturday 09:00 - 13:00)

### PHASE 1: LITERACY & GENERAL KNOWLEDGE (Weeks 1-3)
- **Goal**: Master the "Ask -> Verify -> Refine" loop. Build the General Knowledge Knowledge Base.
- **Projects**:
    - Build "Decoder Prompts" for dense FAA regs.
    - Create a "Drill Sergeant" for General subjects (Math, Physics, Electricity).
- **Outcome**: A working study tool for the General exam.

### PHASE 2: PROCEDURES & SIMULATION (Weeks 4-7)
- **Goal**: Deep dive into Powerplant/Airframe specifics.
- **Projects**:
    - **Procedure Explainer**: Translate manual pages into checklists.
    - **Live Sim**: Troubleshoot "High Oil Temp" or "Low Compression" in class using AI roleplay.
- **Outcome**: Confidence in diagnosing complex systems.

### PHASE 3: THE JOB SHEET TRACKER (Weeks 8-11)
- **Goal**: Make the hands-on work "stick".
- **Projects**:
    - Build the **Job Sheet App** (using Replit/Lovable templates).
    - Log past jobs. Generate flashcards from them.
- **Outcome**: A digital logbook that doubles as a study guide.

### PHASE 4: CAPSTONE & QUALIFIER PREP (Weeks 12-14)
- **Goal**: Integration.
- **Projects**:
    - Combine all tools into the **A&P Co-Pilot**.
    - Full "Mock Exams" generated by the AI based on individual weak spots.
- **Outcome**: Personalized 85% Prep Plan.

### PHASE 5: CERTIFICATION (Weeks 15-16)
- **Location**: In-Person / Hangar.
- **Activity**: Practical Demos. Timed Study Sessions.
- **Final Check**: "Is this tool ready for your 5th Year?"
