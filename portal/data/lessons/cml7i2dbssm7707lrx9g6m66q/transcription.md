[00:00:00] Teacher: Alright everyone, welcome back. Today we are diving into Python's data types.
[00:00:15] Teacher: Think of a variable like a box. You can put different things in it.

[00:00:45] Teacher: If you put a decimal like 3.14, that's a Float.
[00:01:00] Teacher: And text? That's a String. Strings are always wrapped in quotes.
[00:01:30] Teacher: We also have Lists, which are ordered collections, like a shopping list.
