## LEARNING OBJECTIVES (What Students Will Be Able To Do)

By end of Week 1, students will:

1. **Explain** medical AI in plain language as pattern-finding in patient data to support clinical decisions
2. **Identify** 2–3 real-world healthcare applications of AI
3. **Describe** Ask → Verify → Refine and why verification is critical in medicine
4. **Write** a clear prompt asking AI to explain a medical concept, then fact-check it
5. **Articulate** one risk and one benefit of AI in healthcare

---

## LESSON FLOW (44 Minutes)

### 0:00–0:08 | EXERCISE 1: The ICU Risk Predictor Discussion

**Purpose**: Hook students with a real clinical scenario; introduce medical AI

**What you'll do**:
1. Project Slide 2 (ICU scenario)
2. Read scenario aloud
3. Think-pair-share (Slide 3): What data did AI use? What could go wrong?
4. Whole-class share-out; capture responses on board
5. Transition: "That's medical AI. Today we learn what it is and why we verify it."

**Detailed instructions**: See `week1-exercise1-icu-discussion.md`

**Key teaching points**:
- AI uses patient data (vitals, labs, history) to make predictions
- Predictions require human oversight (doctor still decides)
- Verification matters because wrong predictions harm patients

---

### 0:08–0:22 | MINI-LESSON: Core Concepts + Demo

**Purpose**: Teach foundational knowledge about medical AI

**What you'll do**:
1. **Medical AI in plain language** (Slide 4): Pattern-finding in patient data to support decisions
2. **Features & outcomes** (Slide 5): Inputs (vitals, labs) → predictions (diagnosis, risk)
3. **Where AI is used** (Slide 6): Radiology, ICU, pathology, drug discovery
4. **Ask → Verify → Refine** (Slide 7): The workflow students will use all semester
5. **Demo** (Slide 8): Ask AI about sepsis; model verification
6. **Risks & benefits** (Slide 9): Accuracy ≠ fairness

**Detailed slide notes**: See main lesson plan, Section 3 (Slide Deck Outline)

**Key teaching points**:
- Use clinical language students recognize (vitals, labs, diagnosis)
- Connect to biology: "Like hypothesis from data—but thousands of cases"
- Emphasize: AI is a tool, not a replacement

---

### 0:22–0:36 | EXERCISE 2: Prompt, Explain, Verify (Guided Practice)

**Purpose**: Students practice the Ask → Verify → Refine workflow hands-on

**What you'll do**:
1. Distribute handouts; give instructions (Slide 10)
2. **Part 1** (5 min): Students write a prompt, run it (or use sample response)
3. **Part 2** (5 min): Students fact-check against CDC, NIH, or textbook
4. **Part 3** (4 min): Students discuss one risk and one benefit with partner
5. Circulate throughout; check for understanding and support pairs

**Detailed instructions**: See `week1-exercise2-prompt-verify.md`

**Key teaching points**:
- Prompt clarity matters
- Always verify—even if answer sounds right
- Evidence-based practice: check against trusted sources

**Common issues & fixes**:
- Vague prompts → "Be specific. What exactly do you want to know?"
- "I can't find it on CDC" → "Use the search bar. Type your topic."
- Generic risk/benefit → "Can you give a specific example from a hospital setting?"

---

### 0:36–0:42 | EXERCISE 3a: Debrief / Share-Out

**Purpose**: Students share learning; you synthesize key concepts

**What you'll do**:
1. **Prompt & verification** (3 min): 2 students share what they verified
2. **Risks & benefits** (3 min): 2 students share one risk and one benefit
3. **Synthesize** (1 min): Pull together themes; emphasize verification and fairness

**Detailed instructions**: See `week1-exercise3-debrief-exit.md`

**Key teaching points**:
- Verification is non-negotiable in medicine (patient safety)
- AI is powerful AND requires oversight
- Accuracy ≠ fairness (a system can be right on average and still harm some groups)

---

### 0:42–0:44 | EXERCISE 3b: Exit Ticket

**Purpose**: Check for understanding; collect formative assessment data

**What you'll do**:
1. Display Slide 11 (Exit Ticket question)
2. Students submit via Google Classroom (2 min)
3. Circulate to ensure everyone submits

**Exit Ticket Questions**:
1. What is medical AI in plain language?
2. Name one place where AI is used in healthcare.
3. Why is "Verify" especially important in medicine?

**Assessment rubric**: See Exercise 3 guide

---

## DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES

### For students who finish early:
- Write a second prompt on a different topic and fact-check it
- Read partner's work and suggest one improvement
- Research one additional risk or benefit

### For struggling students:
- Provide sentence starters (see Exercise 2 guide)
- Pair with stronger reader
- Point to NIH MedlinePlus (6th–8th grade reading level)

### For students without AI access:
- Use sample AI responses (provided in Exercise 2)
- They write the prompt they WOULD ask, then fact-check the sample

## ANTICIPATED MISCONCEPTIONS & HOW TO ADDRESS

| Misconception | How to Address |
|:--------------|:---------------|
| "AI will replace doctors" | "No—it's a tool that supports clinical judgment. The doctor is still responsible." |
| "If the AI is 90% accurate, it's good enough" | "90% accurate might mean it's wrong 10% of the time. In medicine, who's in that 10%? What happens to them?" |
| "Verification isn't necessary if the AI sounds right" | "Sounding right ≠ being right. That's why we check against CDC, NIH, or research." |
| "Bias just means 'unfair'" | "Bias in AI means it was trained on certain data (e.g., one population) and may not work as well for others." |

---

## TECH TROUBLESHOOTING

| Issue | Fix |
|:------|:----|
| AI tools blocked | Use **sample AI responses** (provided in Exercise 2) |
| CDC/NIH won't load | Use biology/anatomy textbook as backup |
| Google Classroom down | Collect exit tickets on paper (type up later) |
| Student Chromebooks not charged | Pair students; share devices |

---

## CLOSURE & TRANSITION TO WEEK 2

**Final statement** (say at 0:44):

> *"Great work today. You learned what medical AI is, where it's used, and why we verify it. Next class, we'll dive deeper into one specific application: [preview Week 2 topic]. See you then."*

**Before next class**:
- [ ] Read exit tickets; note misconceptions
- [ ] Identify 1–2 strong responses to share next class as examples
- [ ] Reflect: What worked? What needs adjustment?

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

### At end of Week 1, look for:

**Strong evidence**:
- [ ] 80%+ of students can define medical AI in plain language (exit ticket Q1)
- [ ] 80%+ can name a specific healthcare application (exit ticket Q2)
- [ ] 80%+ articulate why verification matters (patient safety, harm prevention)

**Adequate evidence**:
- [ ] Students write clear prompts (not too vague)
- [ ] Students actually check CDC/NIH during fact-checking (not just saying "looks right")
- [ ] Students give specific risks/benefits (not just "bias" or "faster")

**Needs support**:
- If multiple students say "AI replaces doctors" → address next class
- If many struggle with verification → model it again
- If risks/benefits are too generic → provide more scaffolding

---

## TEACHER REFLECTION PROMPTS (After Class)

1. **Engagement**: Did the ICU scenario hook students immediately? What did they find most interesting?

2. **Understanding**: Based on exit tickets, do students grasp the core concepts (pattern-finding, verification, accuracy ≠ fairness)?

3. **Pacing**: Did 44 minutes feel right? What needed more/less time?

4. **Tech**: Did AI access work? Did students navigate CDC/NIH successfully?

5. **Misconceptions**: What came up that I need to address next class?

6. **Adjustments**: What would I change if I teach this again?

---

## NEXT STEPS (Week 2 Preview)

Week 2 could focus on:
- **Option A**: Deep dive into one application (e.g., radiology, pathology, ICU)
- **Option B**: Introduce bias and fairness in medical AI
- **Option C**: Students research a medical AI case study
- **Option D**: Introduction to simple datasets (features and outcomes)

Decision will depend on:
- Exit ticket results
- Student interest/questions from Week 1
- Course trajectory
