- Students will fact-check these instead of generating their own

### 2. **Pre-check trusted sources**

Visit CDC.gov and NIH.gov from school WiFi to confirm they're accessible. Bookmark:
- CDC Sepsis page: https://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/
- NIH MedlinePlus (plain language): https://medlineplus.gov/

### 3. **Print handouts or share digitally**

- Print 1 handout per student, OR
- Share a Google Doc template students can copy

### 4. **Set up pairs**

Decide on pairs ahead of time (or use existing seating). Aim for mixed-ability pairs.

## STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS

### MINUTE 0:22–0:23 — Transition & Instructions (1 min)

**What you do:**

1. Display **Slide 10** (Guided Practice instructions).

2. Say:

> *"Now it's your turn. You're going to practice the Ask → Verify → Refine workflow. You'll work in pairs. You have 14 minutes to complete three tasks on your handout:*
> 1. *Write a clear prompt asking AI to explain one medical concept.*
> 2. *Fact-check the AI's answer using CDC, NIH, or your textbook.*
> 3. *With your partner, write down one risk and one benefit of AI in healthcare.*
>
> *If AI is blocked, I'll give you sample responses to fact-check. Let's go."*

3. Distribute handouts (or direct students to the digital link).

**What students do:**
- Get into pairs
- Open handout (paper or digital)
- Open a browser tab for CDC or NIH

### MINUTE 0:23–0:28 — Part 1: Prompt Writing (5 min)

#### **Instructions for students** (from handout):

> Write a clear prompt asking an AI to explain **ONE** of these:
> - What vital signs and lab values are used to predict deterioration in the ICU?
> - What is sepsis and what are early warning signs?
> - How does AI help radiologists read X-rays?

**What you do (teacher):**

1. Circulate immediately. Check that students are:
   - Writing a **clear, specific** question (not just "tell me about AI")
   - Choosing ONE of the three topics

2. **If AI is accessible**:
   - Help students access the tool (Gemini/ChatGPT/Colab)
   - After they write the prompt, have them run it and read the response
   - They should copy/paste or summarize the AI's answer on their handout

3. **If AI is blocked** (FALLBACK):
   - Provide students with the **sample AI responses** (see Appendix A)
   - They pick the response that matches their topic
   - They write the prompt they WOULD have asked, then use the sample response

**What students do:**
- Write a prompt (1–2 min)
- Run the prompt OR read the sample response (2–3 min)
- Write down the AI's answer on the handout

**Common issues & fixes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|:------|:----|
| Prompt is too vague ("Tell me about AI") | "Be specific. What exactly do you want to know about ICU monitoring or sepsis?" |
| Student stuck on wording | "Start with: 'What is...' or 'How does...' and go from there." |
| AI gives a very long response | "That's fine. Read the first 2–3 sentences and summarize the main point." |

---

### MINUTE 0:28–0:33 — Part 2: Fact-Checking (5 min)

#### **Instructions for students** (from handout):

> Compare the AI's answer to one trusted source: CDC.gov, NIH.gov, or your biology textbook. Fill out the checklist.

**What you do (teacher):**

1. Circulate and check:
   - Are students actually opening CDC or NIH? (Not just Googling randomly)
   - Are they comparing side-by-side? (AI answer vs. trusted source)

2. **Help students navigate sources**:
   - CDC: Use the search bar (e.g., "sepsis symptoms")
   - NIH MedlinePlus: Very readable, plain language
   - Textbook: Index or glossary

3. **Prompt critical thinking**:
   - "Does the AI's answer match what CDC says?"
   - "Is anything missing?"
   - "What would you double-check before using this info with a real patient?"

**What students do:**
- Open CDC, NIH, or textbook
- Search for the relevant topic
- Fill out the fact-checking checklist (4 questions—see handout template)
- Write one sentence summarizing what they verified

**Common issues & fixes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|:------|:----|
| "I can't find it on CDC" | "Try the search bar at the top. Type 'sepsis' or 'vital signs.'" |
| "The AI answer seems right" | "Good! But what's one thing you'd still double-check? What detail might be missing?" |
| "CDC says something different" | "Excellent catch. That's why we verify. Write that down—you just found a discrepancy." |

---

### MINUTE 0:33–0:36 — Part 3: One Risk, One Benefit (3 min)

#### **Instructions for students** (from handout):

> Discuss with your partner. Then write:
> - One **risk** of using AI in healthcare
> - One **benefit**

**What you do (teacher):**

1. Say: *"Final task. Talk with your partner: What's one way AI could help in healthcare? One way it could cause harm? Write 1–2 sentences for each."*

2. Circulate. Listen for:
   - **Risks**: misdiagnosis, bias (worse for some groups), over-reliance (doctors stop thinking), privacy concerns
   - **Benefits**: faster triage, access in underserved areas, consistency (doesn't get tired), catching things humans miss

3. Encourage specifics:
   - Not just "bias"—but "bias if trained mostly on one population"
   - Not just "faster"—but "faster triage in the ER when time matters"

**What students do:**
- Discuss with partner (1–2 min)
- Write down one risk and one benefit
- Prepare to share (1 min)

**Common issues & fixes:**

| Issue | Fix |
|:------|:----|
| "I don't know any risks" | "Think back to the ICU scenario. What if the AI is wrong? What happens?" |
| "All I see are benefits" | "That's one side. But remember: accuracy isn't the same as fairness. What if it works better for some patients than others?" |
| Very generic answers | "Can you be more specific? Give an example of how that risk or benefit would play out in a hospital." |

---

### MINUTE 0:36 — Wrap-Up (Final 10 seconds)

**What you do:**

Say: *"Pencils down. We'll share out in a minute. Be ready to tell the class your prompt and one thing you verified, plus one risk and one benefit."*

Transition to **Debrief / Share-Out** (next part of lesson plan).

---

## KEY TEACHING POINTS

### During Prompt Writing:
- **Clarity matters**: A vague prompt gets a vague answer
- **Specificity helps**: "What vital signs predict deterioration?" is better than "Tell me about ICU AI"

### During Fact-Checking:
- **Always verify**: Even if the AI sounds right, check a trusted source
- **Look for gaps**: AI might be accurate but incomplete
- **Evidence-based practice**: This is what doctors do—check the research

### During Risk/Benefit Discussion:
- **Both matter**: AI has real potential AND real risks
- **Context matters**: A risk in one setting (ICU) might look different in another (radiology)
- **Fairness ≠ Accuracy**: A system can be right on average and still harm certain groups

---

## DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGIES

**For students who finish early:**
- Challenge: "Write a SECOND prompt on a different topic and fact-check it."
- OR: "Read your partner's AI response and see if you find anything they missed."

**For struggling students:**
- Provide sentence starters:
  - "My prompt is: What is [condition] and why does it matter in [setting]?"
  - "One risk is: AI might [misdiagnose / miss patients / be biased] because..."
  - "One benefit is: AI can [speed up / improve consistency / increase access] by..."

**For students without strong reading skills:**
- Pair them with a stronger reader
- Point them to NIH MedlinePlus (written at 6th–8th grade level, very clear)

---

## ASSESSMENT (Formative)

**Circulate and check:**

| Skill | What to Look For |
|:------|:-----------------|
| Prompt writing | Is it clear? Specific? Answerable? |
| Fact-checking | Did they actually open a trusted source? Did they compare? |
| Critical thinking | Did they note what's missing or wrong, not just "it's correct"? |
| Risk/Benefit | Are answers specific (not just "bias" but "bias against certain populations")? |

**Red flags** (intervene if you see these):
- Student writes a prompt but doesn't read the response
- Student says "it's right" without checking a source
- Student can't name a single risk or benefit

## APPENDIX A: SAMPLE AI RESPONSES (If AI Blocked)

Use these if students cannot access AI tools. Print or project them.

---

### **Sample Response 1: Sepsis**

**Student's Prompt**: "What is sepsis and what are early warning signs?"

**AI Response**:
> "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes widespread inflammation. Early warning signs include fever or very low temperature, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, confusion, and extreme pain or discomfort. Early detection is critical because sepsis can lead to organ failure and death if not treated quickly with antibiotics and IV fluids."

**Task for students**: Fact-check this against CDC.gov/sepsis. Is it accurate? Anything missing?

---

### **Sample Response 2: ICU Vital Signs**

**Student's Prompt**: "What vital signs and lab values are used to predict deterioration in the ICU?"

**AI Response**:
> "ICU deterioration prediction often uses vital signs like heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and temperature. Lab values include white blood cell count, lactate (a marker of poor oxygen delivery), and creatinine (kidney function). AI systems analyze trends in these values over time to predict if a patient is at risk of sepsis, cardiac arrest, or other complications."

**Task for students**: Fact-check this against NIH or textbook. Is it accurate? Anything missing?

---

### **Sample Response 3: AI in Radiology**

**Student's Prompt**: "How does AI help radiologists read X-rays?"

**AI Response**:
> "AI helps radiologists by analyzing X-ray images and flagging potential abnormalities like lung nodules, fractures, or signs of pneumonia. The AI is trained on thousands of labeled images, so it can quickly identify patterns that might indicate disease. However, a radiologist always reviews the AI's findings to confirm the diagnosis, because AI can make mistakes, especially with rare conditions or unusual cases."

**Task for students**: Fact-check this. Is it accurate? What would you verify?

## TEACHER REFLECTION (After Class)

- Did students write clear prompts? Or were they too vague?
- Did students actually fact-check, or just say "it looks right"?
- Were students able to name specific risks and benefits, or did they need more scaffolding?
- Time check: Did 14 minutes feel rushed? Just right? Too long?
- Tech issues: Did AI access work? If not, did the sample responses work well?

*"Verify, then act. Evidence first, always."*
