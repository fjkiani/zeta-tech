Prompt for Week 1 Lesson Design Agent
Context
You are designing Week 1 of a high school AI in Medicine & Science course at Bronx HS for Medical Science in NYC. This is a 5x-per-week class (Mondays-Fridays, 10:48 AM – 11:32 AM, ~44 minutes) for juniors/seniors interested in medicine, healthcare, and scientific careers.

Course Philosophy
This is NOT a traditional statistics or biology course. Instead, it's a "new computer literacy" course where the interface is language: students learn to operate AI tools effectively, critically, and responsibly—like a calculator-plus, but for reasoning, writing, studying, and building projects in medical and scientific contexts.

Core workflow students will practice throughout the semester:
Ask → Verify → Refine

This mirrors the clinical decision-making process: gather data → form hypothesis → test against evidence → revise.

Course Theme
"Data to Diagnosis: AI in Healthcare"

Students learn to evaluate AI as a clinical decision-support tool. Every AI system is interrogated through a medical lens: What data does it use? What does it predict? How could it help patients? How could it cause harm? The guiding ethical principle is "first, do no harm."

Week 1 Specific Goals
Learning Objectives
By the end of Week 1 (44 minutes), students should be able to:

Explain what medical AI is in plain language (pattern-finding in patient data to support clinical decisions)

Identify 2-3 real-world healthcare applications of AI (diagnosis support, risk prediction, imaging analysis, drug discovery)

Describe the Ask → Verify → Refine workflow and why verification is critical in medical contexts (patient safety, evidence-based practice)

Write one clear prompt asking an AI to explain a medical concept, then fact-check the response against a trusted source

Articulate one risk of using AI in healthcare (misdiagnosis, bias, over-reliance, privacy) and one potential benefit (access, speed, consistency)

Key Concepts to Introduce
AI in medicine: analyzing patient data (vitals, labs, imaging, history) to predict outcomes or suggest diagnoses

Supervised learning simplified: AI learns from examples (past patients → patterns → predictions for new patients)

Features and outcomes in medical context: symptoms/test results (inputs) → diagnosis/risk level (outputs)

Where AI is already used in healthcare: radiology, pathology, ICU monitoring, drug interactions, clinical trials

Why accuracy alone isn't enough: false positives vs false negatives, equity in healthcare, trust

Constraints & Context
Student Profile
Grade level: Juniors and seniors (ages 16-18)

School identity: Pre-med/health professions focus; students planning careers as doctors, nurses, researchers, public health workers

Prior knowledge: Strong biology background likely; some chemistry; may have minimal tech/coding exposure; likely understand scientific method

Motivation: Care deeply about helping people, evidence-based practice, health equity

Class size: ~20-25 students (typical NYC public high school class)

Technical Environment
AI tool access: May be blocked on school WiFi; plan for teacher-demo mode as fallback

Classroom setup: Projector available; students have Chromebooks/laptops; Google Classroom for assignments

Tools available: Google Colab (usually works), Gemini/ChatGPT (may be blocked), teacher's screen for live demos

Medical resources: Students can access CDC.gov, NIH.gov, PubMed (won't be blocked)

Time Structure (44 minutes)
0:00–0:08: Hook + clinical case intro

0:08–0:22: Mini-lesson + demo

0:22–0:36: Guided practice (individual or pairs)

0:36–0:42: Debrief/share-out

0:42–0:44: Exit ticket

Deliverables Requested
1. Week 1 Learning Objectives (detailed)
Provide:

3-5 specific, measurable learning objectives using Bloom's taxonomy verbs (remember, understand, apply, analyze)

For each objective, note how it will be assessed in Week 1 (observation, exit ticket, think-pair-share, worksheet, etc.)

2. Lesson Plan Outline
Include:

Hook/Opener (5-8 min): An engaging clinical scenario or question that shows AI's potential in healthcare. Should feel immediately relevant to their future careers.

Mini-Lesson (14 min): Core content delivery. Keep it interactive with medical examples. Use clinical language students recognize from biology class. Introduce 1-2 key vocabulary terms max.

Guided Practice (14 min): Students try something hands-on. Could be: analyzing patient data, writing/critiquing prompts for medical explanations, exploring an AI health tool demo, discussing a clinical case.

Debrief (6 min): Structured share-out (2 students/groups present findings or ethical concerns).

Exit Ticket (2 min): One focused question checking understanding of AI's role in medicine.

3. Slide Deck Structure (10-12 slides max)
Outline the slide deck with:

Slide titles and key content bullets

Suggested visuals (medical images, data visualizations, screenshots—describe what should be shown)

Speaker notes for complex slides (what to say, what questions to ask, what analogies to use)

At least one interactive slide (poll question, think-pair-share prompt, or clinical scenario for discussion)

4. Student Handout/Worksheet (optional but recommended)
If applicable, describe a 1-page handout students use during guided practice. Could include:

A simplified patient case with data (age, vitals, symptoms, test results)

A prompt template for asking AI to explain a medical condition

A fact-checking checklist (verify against CDC/NIH/textbook)

Reflection questions about AI risks and benefits

5. Exit Ticket Question
Provide the exact wording of the exit ticket question that students submit via Google Classroom at end of class.

Pedagogical Guidelines
What Works for This Audience
Start with patients: Use concrete clinical scenarios where AI could help (or hurt) real people

Medical/scientific framing: Frame AI as a diagnostic tool or clinical assistant that requires doctor oversight—students should think like future clinicians

Connect to what they know: Reference biology concepts they've learned (patterns in genetics, immune response, etc.)

Evidence-based mindset: Emphasize verification—"How would we check if this AI's prediction is accurate? What does the research say?"

Health equity lens: Many students from underserved communities—discuss disparities, bias in medical AI, access to care

Career relevance: Show how AI will be part of their future practice as doctors/nurses/researchers

What to Avoid
Don't oversimplify medical concepts—these students can handle clinical terminology

Don't make it too technical/mathematical—focus on concepts, not algorithms

Don't ignore ethics—medical students are trained to think about patient welfare first

Don't separate AI from the human: emphasize AI as tool, not replacement for clinical judgment

Don't use only success stories—show where AI has failed or caused harm in healthcare

Sample Scenarios to Consider
Option A: "The ICU Risk Predictor"
Introduce sepsis prediction or deterioration alerts used in hospitals. Show simplified patient data (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, labs). AI predicts "high risk of deterioration in next 6 hours." Ask: What would you do as the doctor? What if the AI is wrong? What happens to patients the AI misses?

Option B: "The X-Ray Reader"
Show chest X-rays (you can find educational examples). Explain AI can flag potential pneumonia, COVID, or lung cancer. Discuss: What patterns does AI look for? Could it work differently for patients from different populations? Should a doctor always review the AI's decision?

Option C: "The Medical Literature Assistant"
Students pick a common condition (diabetes, asthma, hypertension). They ask AI to explain symptoms, risk factors, and treatment. Then fact-check against CDC/NIH. Discuss: What did AI get right? What was incomplete or wrong? How do doctors verify information?

Option D: "Who Gets the Organ?"
Transplant allocation scenario. AI ranks patients for kidney transplant based on medical data. Students see simplified profiles (age, health status, time on waitlist). Discuss: Is this fair? What factors should matter? What shouldn't? How do we audit the algorithm?

Choose ONE scenario for Week 1 that best introduces AI in healthcare while engaging their clinical interests and ethical thinking.

Output Format
Please provide:

Learning Objectives (bulleted list with assessment notes)

Lesson Plan Outline (narrative format with time stamps)

Slide Deck Outline (slide-by-slide with titles, bullets, visual descriptions, and speaker notes)

Exit Ticket Question (exact wording)

Optional: Student Handout Description (if needed for guided practice)

Keep the tone professional, evidence-based, and patient-centered. These students should leave Week 1 thinking: "AI is a powerful tool in medicine, it's already being used in hospitals, and as future healthcare workers, I need to use it responsibly and verify everything."

Constraint: Total class time is 44 minutes. Be realistic about pacing. Better to explore one clinical case deeply with ethical discussion than to rush through multiple concepts superficially.

Success criteria: If a student leaves Week 1 able to say "Medical AI finds patterns in patient data to help doctors make decisions, it's used in [specific example like radiology or ICU monitoring], and we need to verify it doesn't cause harm"—you've succeeded.

Medical accuracy note: All clinical examples should be educationally appropriate, avoid graphic content, and use terminology these students would recognize from high school biology/anatomy. When in doubt, frame scenarios around common conditions (diabetes, heart disease, infections) rather than rare diseases.
