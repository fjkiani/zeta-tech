# OPERATION: VIPER (Bushwick Leaders HS) 🐍

**Mission**: Python for Tool Builders.
**The Deal**: We don't just write code. We build **Tools** that solve real problems.
**The Strategy**: "Spec-First". Whether the AI helps you or not, YOU define the logic.
**The Constraints**: 45 Minutes Daily. Strict Focus.

## 🛤️ THE DUAL-TRACK PROTOCOL
*We adapt to the network environment every single day.*

### TRACK A: ENHANCED (AI Accessible)
1.  **Write the Spec** (The Prompt).
2.  **Generate Draft**: AI (Replit Ghostwriter/Gemini) writes the boilerplate.
3.  **Debug & Refine**: You fix the logic errors.
4.  **Ship**: It runs.

### TRACK B: FALLBACK (AI Blocked)
1.  **Write the Spec** (The Prompt).
2.  **Teacher Demo**: We run *one* example on the big screen.
3.  **Hand-Code**: You write the Python yourself, following your strict Spec.
4.  **Ship**: It runs.

*The skill is the same: Turning fuzzy ideas into precise instructions.*

## 📜 THE "SPEC-FIRST" RULE
*Before you touch the keyboard, you write the Spec. This IS your prompt.*

1.  **GOAL**: What does this tool DO?
2.  **INPUTS**: What does the user type?
3.  **OUTPUTS**: What does the screen show?
4.  **EDGE CASES**: What if the user types "banana" instead of a number?

## ⏱️ THE DAILY BURNOUT (45 Minutes)

| Time | Activity |
| :--- | :--- |
| **00-05** | **Warm-Up**: "Fix this broken code" OR "Critique this Prompt". |
| **05-15** | **Mini-Lesson**: One concept (e.g., `if/else`). Show how to *Prompt* for it. |
| **15-35** | **Build Time**: Pairs. Write Spec -> Write Code. Teacher circulates. |
| **35-42** | **Show & Tell**: 2 students demo their tool on screen. Class spots bugs. |
| **42-45** | **Exit Ticket**: Submit your Spec + One improvement. |

## 🛠️ THE TOOL BOX (Weekly Arcs)

### WEEK 1: THE QUIZ BOT (Variables & Conditionals)
- **Goal**: A bot that asks questions and tracks score.
- **Micro-Tools**:
    - *Day 1 (Greeter)*: `input()` + `print()`.
    - *Day 2 (Judge)*: `if/else` (Right/Wrong).
    - *Day 3 (Looper)*: `while` (Keep asking until right).
    - *Captsone*: "The Impossible Quiz".

### WEEK 2: THE HOMEWORK PLANNER (Lists & Loops)
- **Goal**: A CLI tool to manage your life.
- **Tech**: Lists to store tasks. Loops to print them.
- **AI Mode**: "Reviewer Mode" (Find my bug).

### WEEK 3: THE TEXT CLEANER (String Manipulation)
- **Goal**: Paste messy text, get clean text.
- **Tech**: Methods (`.strip()`, `.upper()`).
- **AI Mode**: "Tutor Mode" (Explain this function).

### WEEK 4: THE GRADE CALCULATOR (Functions & Math)
- **Goal**: "What do I need on the final to pass?"
- **Tech**: Custom Functions. Return values.
- **AI Mode**: "Test Writer" (Generate 5 edge cases to break my code).

## 🎒 DEPLOYMENT KIT
- **Platform**: **Replit** (Teams for Education).
- **Backup**: Google Colab (if Replit blocked).
- **Ultimate Backup**: Python IDLE (Local) + Notepad (for Specs).

*Prometheus Note: "A coder who can't write a Spec is just a typist. Be an Architect."*
