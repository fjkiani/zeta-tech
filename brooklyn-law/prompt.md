Prompt for Week 1 Lesson Design Agent
Context
You are designing Week 1 of a high school Intro to Machine Learning course at Brooklyn HS of Law & Technology in NYC. This is a once-per-week class (Tuesdays, 9:32 AM, ~50 minutes) for juniors/seniors interested in law, policy, and technology.

Course Philosophy
This is NOT a traditional math-heavy ML course. Instead, it's a "new computer literacy" course where the interface is language: students learn to operate AI tools effectively, critically, and responsibly—like a calculator-plus, but for reasoning, writing, studying, and building projects.

Core workflow students will practice throughout the semester:
Ask → Verify → Refine

Course Theme
"AI, Justice, and Data: How Algorithms Shape Decisions"

Students interrogate ML systems the way lawyers cross-examine witnesses. Every model is questioned: What does it decide? Who does it help? Who does it harm? Should we trust it?

Week 1 Specific Goals
Learning Objectives
By the end of Week 1 (50 minutes), students should be able to:

Explain what machine learning is in plain language (pattern-finding from examples, not programming explicit rules)

Identify 2-3 real-world decisions currently made by ML systems (with at least one from law/justice domain)

Describe the Ask → Verify → Refine workflow and why verification matters when using AI

Write one clear prompt asking an AI to explain an ML concept, then evaluate the response for accuracy

Articulate one ethical concern about using ML for decision-making (bias, fairness, transparency, or accountability)

Key Concepts to Introduce
Machine learning vs. traditional programming (rules vs. patterns)

Supervised learning (high-level only: examples → predictions)

Features and labels (inputs and outcomes) using non-technical language

Where ML is already used in law/justice: risk scores, facial recognition, content moderation, hiring algorithms

Why "accuracy" isn't the same as "fairness"

Constraints & Context
Student Profile
Grade level: Juniors and seniors (ages 16-18)

School identity: Law & Technology focus; students likely interested in careers in law, policy, social justice, tech ethics

Prior knowledge: Assume no ML background; some may have basic coding exposure but don't assume it

Class size: ~20-25 students (typical NYC public high school class)

Technical Environment
AI tool access: May be blocked on school WiFi; plan for teacher-demo mode as fallback

Classroom setup: Projector available; students have Chromebooks/laptops; Google Classroom for assignments

Tools available: Google Colab (usually works), Gemini/ChatGPT (may be blocked), teacher's screen for live demos

Time Structure (50 minutes)
0:00–0:10: Hook + case intro

0:10–0:25: Mini-lesson + demo

0:25–0:40: Guided practice (individual or pairs)

0:40–0:48: Debrief/share-out

0:48–0:50: Exit ticket

Deliverables Requested
1. Week 1 Learning Objectives (detailed)
Provide:

3-5 specific, measurable learning objectives using Bloom's taxonomy verbs (remember, understand, apply, analyze)

For each objective, note how it will be assessed in Week 1 (observation, exit ticket, think-pair-share, etc.)

2. Lesson Plan Outline
Include:

Hook/Opener (5-10 min): An engaging scenario or question that connects to law/justice and sets up the ML concept. Should feel relevant to their lives and interests.

Mini-Lesson (15 min): Core content delivery. Keep it interactive—use examples, visuals, quick checks for understanding. Introduce 1-2 key vocabulary terms max.

Guided Practice (15 min): Students try something hands-on. Could be: analyzing a simple dataset, writing/critiquing prompts, exploring an ML tool demo, discussing a case scenario.

Debrief (8 min): Structured share-out (2-3 students/groups present findings or insights).

Exit Ticket (2 min): One quick question that checks for understanding of the day's core concept.

3. Slide Deck Structure (10-15 slides max)
Outline the slide deck with:

Slide titles and key content bullets

Suggested visuals (diagrams, screenshots, photos—describe what should be shown)

Speaker notes for tricky slides (what to say, what questions to ask students)

At least one interactive slide (poll question, think-pair-share prompt, or scenario for discussion)

4. Student Handout/Worksheet (optional but recommended)
If applicable, describe a 1-page handout students use during guided practice. Could include:

A simple dataset to analyze

A prompt template to fill in

A scenario to discuss with a partner

Sentence starters for the debrief

5. Exit Ticket Question
Provide the exact wording of the exit ticket question that students submit via Google Classroom at end of class.

Pedagogical Guidelines
What Works for This Audience
Start with real stakes: Use concrete examples from news, social media, or their lives (e.g., "Should TikTok use an algorithm to decide what you see?")

Law/justice framing: Frame ML as a "decision-making system" that can be interrogated like evidence in court

Minimal jargon: When introducing technical terms, immediately translate to plain language and give an example

Collaborative discussion: Law students like to debate—build in moments for them to argue, question, critique

Verify everything: Model skepticism—show an AI output and ask "How would we check if this is true?"

What to Avoid
Don't lead with math, matrices, or code syntax

Don't assume they know what "algorithm" or "data" means in technical contexts

Don't make it abstract—every concept needs a real-world example (preferably law/justice-related)

Don't skip the ethics—these students care deeply about fairness and impact

Sample Scenarios to Consider
Option A: "The Bail Algorithm"
Introduce COMPAS or similar risk assessment tools used in criminal justice. Show how they predict "risk of reoffending." Ask: What data goes in? What decision comes out? Who benefits? Who might be harmed?

Option B: "College Admissions AI"
Hypothetical: A college uses ML to rank applications. Students see a simple dataset (GPA, test scores, zip code → Admit/Reject). Discuss: What patterns might it find? What could go wrong? Is this fair?

Option C: "Facial Recognition at School"
Scenario: NYC proposes using facial recognition for school security. Students debate: What are the risks? What safeguards would you require? How would you test if it's biased?

Choose ONE scenario for Week 1 that best introduces the core concepts while engaging their interests.

Output Format
Please provide:

Learning Objectives (bulleted list with assessment notes)

Lesson Plan Outline (narrative format with time stamps)

Slide Deck Outline (slide-by-slide with titles, bullets, visual descriptions, and speaker notes)

Exit Ticket Question (exact wording)

Optional: Student Handout Description (if needed for guided practice)

Keep the tone accessible, engaging, and skeptical. These students should leave Week 1 thinking: "AI is powerful, it's already everywhere, and I need to ask hard questions about it."

Constraint: Total class time is 50 minutes. Be realistic about pacing. Better to go deep on one concept with discussion than to rush through five concepts superficially.

Success criteria: If a student leaves Week 1 able to say "Machine learning finds patterns in data to make predictions, it's used in [specific example], and we need to check if it's fair"—you've succeeded.
